feat: integrate config_store into app_startup

Adds config_store initialization to the generic startup flow.

Changes:
- Added config_store_init() in app_startup Phase 1 (before config_mgr)
- Removed redundant nvs_flash_init() from main.c (now handled by config_store)
- Added config_store dependency to app_startup CMakeLists.txt

Startup order (Phase 1):
1. config_store_init() - Initialize NVS with auto-erase handling
2. event_bus_init() - Event system
3. config_mgr_init() - Configuration manager (will use config_store later)
4. wdt_mgr_init() - Watchdog manager

Rationale:
- config_store provides standalone NVS initialization
- config_mgr will eventually migrate to use config_store APIs
- Both components coexist during transition period
- NVS init moved to config_store for better encapsulation
