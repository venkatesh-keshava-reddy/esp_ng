fix: move WiFi restart to worker task to avoid blocking timer callback

Resolves PR review feedback about blocking esp_timer callback during WiFi restart.

Problem:
- reconnect_timer_callback() was calling vTaskDelay(1000) and esp_wifi_stop/start
- esp_timer executes all timers from single high-priority task
- Blocking for 1 second delayed all other timer-driven functions in the system

Solution:
- Created dedicated wifi_restart_task worker with queue-based dispatch
- Timer callback now sends non-blocking queue message to trigger restart
- All blocking operations (vTaskDelay, esp_wifi_stop/start) moved to worker task
- Worker task can safely block without impacting other timers

Implementation:
- Added s_restart_task and s_restart_queue static variables
- wifi_restart_task() handles blocking WiFi stop/restart operations
- reconnect_timer_callback() dispatches restart via xQueueSend (non-blocking)
- Queue depth of 1 (only one pending restart needed)
- Worker task created in net_mgr_start() with 3KB stack, priority 5
