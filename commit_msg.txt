feat: implement feedback improvements for production readiness

Addresses additional feedback items for improved reliability and usability:

1. UDP Broadcast Improvements:
   - Log level already at DEBUG for routine sends (reduces flash wear)
   - Made queue size configurable via udp/queue_size (default: 10, max: 50)
   - Allows handling burst scenarios without dropping packets

2. Network Manager Enhancements:
   - Cap retry attempts at 20 before full WiFi restart
   - Prevents long-term stuck states during network issues
   - Automatic recovery mechanism for persistent failures
   - Defensive error handling for WiFi restart in timer context
   - Handles ESP_ERR_WIFI_NOT_STARTED gracefully
   - Incremental retry on restart failure to prevent tight loops

3. Watchdog Coverage:
   - Added watchdog registration for UDP broadcast_task
   - HTTP UI excluded with clear rationale (uses ESP-IDF httpd thread pool)
   - Documented exclusion criteria in wdt_mgr.h

4. HTTP UI Setup Mode:
   - Implemented 15-minute setup mode after first boot
   - Persists timestamp to NVS (survives reboots)
   - Allows default password for initial configuration only
   - Reduces support friction while maintaining security
   - Clear warnings and countdown timer in status endpoint
   - Setup window doesn't reset on power-cycle

5. Configuration Validation:
   - UDP: Validate addr/port/mode/ttl at load time
   - SNTP: Validate server hostname lengths
   - Prevents runtime failures and noisy retry loops
   - Automatic fallback to sane defaults

All changes maintain backward compatibility with existing configurations.
