fix: allow HTTP UI startup during clock rollback with default password

Prevents permanent lockout when RTC resets after timestamp is stored.

Problem:
- Previous fix clamped elapsed_sec to SETUP_MODE_DURATION_SEC + 1 during rollback
- This made elapsed_sec >= SETUP_MODE_DURATION_SEC, triggering the expired check
- Expired check returns ESP_ERR_INVALID_STATE, blocking HTTP UI startup
- Result: User still locked out - contradicted stated intent
- Common on batteryless ESP32 devices after power loss

Root cause analysis:
Cannot reliably determine if setup window truly expired during clock rollback:
- Clock at epoch (time=0) < stored timestamp (e.g., time=1700000000)
- Actual elapsed time is unknown until SNTP resyncs
- Safer to allow temporary access than permanent lockout

Solution:
- Clock rollback: Fall through weak password check (don't return error)
- Allows HTTP UI to start with default password during rollback
- After time resyncs, proper elapsed time validation resumes
- User can change password via HTTP UI during rollback period
- If setup window was actually expired, next boot will block (after time sync)

Code flow:
1. Clock rollback detected → Log warning → Fall through (no return)
2. Normal time + within window → Log setup mode → Fall through (no return)
3. Normal time + expired → Log error → return ESP_ERR_INVALID_STATE (blocks UI)

Security trade-off:
- Accept temporary window extension during clock rollback
- Better than permanent lockout requiring hardware/API intervention
- Window auto-corrects after time resync
