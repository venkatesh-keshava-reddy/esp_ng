fix: update status endpoint to use new setup-mode timestamp variables

The status handler still referenced the old variable names that were renamed
in the previous commit, causing a compilation failure.

Problem:
- Status endpoint referenced s_first_boot_time_ms (undefined)
- Status endpoint referenced SETUP_MODE_DURATION_MS (undefined)
- Build failed due to undefined symbols
- Setup mode logic was never executed

Solution:
- Updated to s_first_boot_timestamp (time_t)
- Updated to SETUP_MODE_DURATION_SEC (seconds)
- Changed calculations from milliseconds to seconds
- Changed format specifiers: %lld → %ld for time_t
