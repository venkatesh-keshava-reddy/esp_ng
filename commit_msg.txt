fix: clamp clock rollback instead of blocking HTTP UI startup

Prevents deadlock when RTC resets after valid timestamp is stored.

Problem:
- When stored first_boot_timestamp exists and clock resets to epoch (before SNTP)
- Previous code returned ESP_ERR_INVALID_STATE, blocking http_ui_start
- app_startup only calls http_ui_start once (doesn't retry after time sync)
- Result: HTTP UI permanently disabled, user locked out with default password
- No way to change password because UI never starts
- Common scenario: power loss on batteryless ESP32 devices

Solution:
- Treat clock rollback as "setup window expired" instead of fatal error
- Clamp elapsed_sec to SETUP_MODE_DURATION_SEC + 1 when rollback detected
- This makes elapsed_sec >= SETUP_MODE_DURATION_SEC, failing the setup check
- HTTP UI still starts but blocks due to default password (existing behavior)
- User can change password via config_mgr API
- After time resyncs, proper elapsed time will be calculated
- Changed log level from ERROR to WARN for rollback detection

Behavior:
- Clock rollback: HTTP UI starts but blocks on default password (must use API)
- Within setup window: HTTP UI accepts default password with countdown
- After setup window: HTTP UI blocks on default password (must use API)
