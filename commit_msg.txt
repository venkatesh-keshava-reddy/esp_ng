fix: address PR feedback on setup mode and WiFi restart recovery

Resolves two critical issues identified in PR review.

Issue 1: Setup mode timestamp resets on reboot
Problem:
- Used esp_timer_get_time() (uptime) instead of wall-clock time
- Uptime resets to 0 on every boot, granting fresh 15-minute window
- Device with default credentials for hours could restart and regain access
- Defeated the intended security gate

Solution:
- Changed to use time(NULL) for Unix timestamp (wall-clock time)
- Timestamp persists correctly across reboots in NVS
- Renamed variables: s_first_boot_time_ms → s_first_boot_timestamp
- Changed duration: SETUP_MODE_DURATION_MS → SETUP_MODE_DURATION_SEC
- Added graceful handling for pre-time-sync case (extends window but safe)

Issue 2: WiFi restart doesn't resume reconnects on failure
Problem:
- When retry count hits MAX_RETRY_BEFORE_RESTART, timer callback enqueues restart and returns
- If esp_wifi_start() fails in worker task, no further attempts scheduled
- Station left permanently offline until manual intervention
- Previously, backoff loop kept retrying indefinitely

Solution:
- Worker task now reschedules reconnect timer on restart failure
- Uses same exponential backoff algorithm (1s → 60s cap)
- Increments retry counter to prevent tight loops
- Ensures system never stops trying to recover connectivity
- Successful restart triggers WIFI_EVENT_STA_START → auto-connect

Files modified:
- components/http_ui/http_ui.c: Fixed setup mode timestamp to use time(NULL)
- components/net_mgr/net_mgr.c: Added timer rescheduling in wifi_restart_task
