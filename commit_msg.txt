fix: clamp setup mode window when clock resets backwards

Prevents indefinite default-password access when RTC is unsynchronized.

Problem:
- Setup mode calculates elapsed_sec = time(NULL) - s_first_boot_timestamp
- On batteryless ESP32 devices, clock starts at epoch 0 before SNTP sync
- If stored timestamp exists, current_time < s_first_boot_timestamp
- This makes elapsed_sec negative, which passes the < SETUP_MODE_DURATION_SEC check
- Result: HTTP UI accepts default password indefinitely on every cold boot
- Defeats the intended one-time 15-minute security window

Solution:
1. First boot validation:
   - Only start setup window timer if time > 2020-01-01 (timestamp > 1577836800)
   - Prevents storing epoch timestamps that would cause issues
   - If time not synced: allow access but don't start timer (wait for SNTP)

2. Clock reset detection:
   - Check if current_time < s_first_boot_timestamp before calculating elapsed
   - Block HTTP UI startup with clear error message
   - Prevents access after clock reset until time resyncs

3. Status endpoint:
   - Added same clock reset detection in status handler
   - Shows "Clock reset detected! Waiting for time sync" warning
   - Marks setup_mode as false when clock reset detected
